# FooBarQix

It's about to implement a function which implements the following rules : 

- If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
- If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
- For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

Also we must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be replaced by char '*'.
